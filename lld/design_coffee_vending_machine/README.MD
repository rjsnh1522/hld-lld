### Design a Coffee Machine
- Design a coffee machine which makes different beverages based on set ingredients. 
- The initialization of the recipes for each drink should be hard-coded, although it should be relatively easy to add new drinks. 
- The machine should display the ingredient stock (+cost) and menu upon startup, and after every piece of valid user input. 
- Drink cost is determined by the combination of ingredients. 
- For example, Coffee is 3 units of coffee (75 cents per), 1 unit of sugar (25 cents per), 1 unit of cream (25 cents per). 
- Ingredients and Menu items should be printed in alphabetical order. 
- If the drink is out of stock, it should print accordingly. 
- If the drink is in stock, it should print "Dispensing: ". 
- To select a drink, the user should input a relevant number. 
- If they submit "r" or "R" the ingredients should restock, and "q" or "Q" should quit. 
- Blank lines should be ignored, and invalid input should print an invalid input message.
